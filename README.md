# wrc-controller
This allows you to remotely control a device using a mobile web browser using via web-remote-control proxy.

This is a very specific module.  Unless you are creating a remote control sailboat using [web-remote-control](https://github.com/psiphi75/web-remote-control)
you probably don't want it.

However, it could be a good starting point for other Remotely Controlled devices.
